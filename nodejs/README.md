## @latitude-data/jwt
Probably by the time you see this we already published a packages called `@latitude-data/jwt` that will help you to implement JWT authentication in your backend application.

But if you're helping us debug some issue you can fork our monorepo and run the following command to test this package:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:latitude-dev/latitude.git ~/YOUR_PATH/latitude
```

Now in this folder `./nodejs` you can locally link our jwt package:
```bash
pnpm link ~/YOUR_PATH/latitude/packages/jwt
```
